## R programming skillset _ essential pipeline of kernel regression

```{r}
# Step 1 -> Read data into R workstation

#### Read data from a CSV file 
# filename
setwd("C:/Users/shuai/Downloads")
data <- read.csv(file = "KR.csv", header = TRUE)
# str(data)
```

```{r}
# Step 2 -> Data preprocessing
# Create your X matrix (predictors) and Y vector (outcome variable)
X <- data$x
Y <- data$y

# Make sure the outcome variable is legitimate. If it is a continuous variable (regression problem), it should be defined as a "num" variable in R. If it is a binary or a more genernal categorical variable (classification problem), it should be defined as a "factor" variable in R. 

# Create a training data (half the original data size)
train.ix <- sample(nrow(data),floor( nrow(data) * 4/5) )
data.train <- data[train.ix,]
# Create a testing data (half the original data size)
data.test <- data[-train.ix,]

```

```{r}
# Step 3 -> gather a list of candidate models
# Kernel regression: often to compare models with different kernels, different values of the bandwidth of the kernel, different set of variables

# Use different values of bandwidth

# model1: ksmooth(x,y, kernel = "normal", bandwidth=10)
# model2: ksmooth(x,y, kernel = "normal", bandwidth=30)

```


```{r}
# Step 4 -> Use 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate all the models

# First, let me use 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of model1
n_folds = 10 # number of fold (the parameter K as we say, K-fold cross validation)
N <- dim(data.train)[1] # the sample size, N, of the dataset
folds_i <- sample(rep(1:n_folds, length.out = N)) # This randomly creates a labeling vector (1 X N) for the N samples. For example, if N = 16, and I run this function and it returns the value as 5  4  4 10  6  7  6  8  3  2  1  5  3  9  2  1. That means, the first sample is allocated to the 5th fold, the 2nd and 3rd samples are allocated to the 4th fold, etc.
